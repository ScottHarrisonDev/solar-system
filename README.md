# Solar System
A small project which displays the planets of the Solar System, using React, Node and TypeScript.

This repository is broken down into two separate folders, the `server` which serves the data via an API and the `app` which consumes this API. Each of these folders have their own respective README.md. In a commercial environment each of these would be in their own repository.
