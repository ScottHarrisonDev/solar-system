# Solar System
A small project which displays the planets of the Solar System, using React, Node and TypeScript.

This repository is broken down into two separate folders, the `server` which serves the data via an API and the `app` which consumes this API. Each of these folders have their own respective README.md. In a commercial environment each of these would be in their own repository.

## Contributing
### GitHub flow
For this project I have used a very basic implementation of GitHub Flow which you can find more information on here: https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/

The basic flow for adding a new feature or fixing a bug would be:

1. Pull the latest version of master
2. Create a branch from master into feature/TASK-NAME, for example feature/update-readme-deploy-instructions
3. Make any changes you require in this branch
4. Submit a pull request from your feature branch back to the master branch
5. Once approved merge your feature branch into master and push
