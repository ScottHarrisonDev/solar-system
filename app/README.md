# Solar System App

This is an React app which displays some information about the planets (and star) in our Solar System.

## Install
1. Clone the Git repository.
2. Copy the `.env.example` file into `.env` and make any changes required (details about each option can be found within the example file).
3. Open a terminal at the project root and run `yarn install`, this will install all the dependencies for the project.
3. From the project root run `yarn start` to start the server. You should see a message to say 'Compiled successfully!' and if you navigate to http://localhost:3000 you should see the web app. Ensure that the Node.js server is running and you will then be able to see the planets (and star) in the website. You are now ready to develop locally.

## Deploy
1. Clone the Git repository (Some hosting platforms will handle this for you).
2. Run `yarn install` from the project root, this will install all the dependencies for the project.
3. Run `yarn build` from the project root, this will build the application for a production environment.
4. Serve the build folder in your hosting platform of choice.
